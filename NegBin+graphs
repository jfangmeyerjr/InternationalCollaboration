  Está bien. I used working directory. I showed that Mexico is a significant variable in the 
model. The problem is that the model is not as realistic as it could be.
1. The model does not consider time. Citations accumulate over time. The function assumes 
that all observations of citations occurred instantaneously in one period.
2. The model takes universities as individuals. The process implied is that each university
has an inherent citation generating capability, and that this capability varies based on 
Mexico or not Mexico. This makes it more difficult to incorporate time into the model because
it would need to be done from the first collaborative publication, but collaboration is not
done consistently over time. The second problem is that many universities contribute to the
same paper. For example, over 50 universities worked on a paper with 40 citations.
3. No continuous or other variables included. Co-authors at Tec or Views Per Publication could
be useful.
